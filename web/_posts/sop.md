## Idea

The purpose of the Project TAG is to facilitate students of the program FOUR18 Intelligence with the environment for practicing Red & Blue team security tasks.

Initial idea of this project is tied to the childrens game tag, the idea of the project was for two or more students to be split into two team red and blue and practice respective security tasks.

The students would be provided with a cloud environment that would have 0 infrastructure security hardening. Then a blue security team would implement security measures, while leaving an attack vector, or vulnerability for red team to discover.

## Provisioning - Linux

Seting up and practicing security tasks is highly dependend on the infrastructure at hand. At FOUR18 program we recieved Enterprise Defense Administrator certificate after studying the course. This course went explained a lot about how we can secure on-premises infrastructure. So first project had to encompas those tasks.

The first project would have minimal functionality of the online business - a web store, some client infromation, and most importantly cloud infrastructure that mimics on-premises operations.

## Activity

To practice Project TAG tasks student have to request LAB environment to be launched. Ideally EC2 instances, default security groups, VPC, web application, API instance, DB server, would be all spun up automatically. As of now based on the demand and on the time constraint the environment is static and cannot be duplicated.
